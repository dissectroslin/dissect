# DISSECT (new version)
DISSECT was designed for being able to perform common genomic analysis on big supercomputers thus allowing to analyze very large datasets. DISSECT capabilities include analysis using mixed linear models, principal components analysis, genome-wide association analysis (testing markers individually or in together in big groups), among others. It is designed for being as easy to use as other common software tools such as PLINK or GCTA/REACTA. In addition, despite its capability of working in supercomputers, it can be used also in single computers without problems.

DISSECT is designed for running on distributed environment systems. In this regard, it uses an implementation of ScaLAPACK libraries and some of the available MPI libraries which are present in nearly all supercomputers. However, this does not prevent DISSECT to run on single computers with smaller datasets provided that these libraries are present.

DISSECT was developed in Roslin Institute.
